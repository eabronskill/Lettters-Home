    have done my time in the Reserve. Then I shall be able to pay you back for I get
    30/- as a bounty. I hope you and Dad will forgive me for what I done when at home.
    I cannot write no more at present for I have to do some more work. Trusting you
    will forgive me. I remain your son,\r\nStephen Brown\r\n\r\nDear Mother\r\nJust

    Hammond are all right. Give my love to Kitty, Lillie, Maggie, Freddy, and Ted.
    I hope Dad is quite well\u2026 I thank you for forgiving me. I know I don\u2019t
    deserve it. Tell Auntie Tot and Uncle Bob that I am getting on fine. Is Uncle

    a line to let you know that I got the fags on Tuesday. I thank you very much for
    sending them\u2026 They have stopped the weekend passes as there are a lot of
    absences, but I shall ask the Captain for permission to come on a pass. We are
    going to the front on the 19 of November. Dear mother, do not worry about me for
    by God\u2019s help I shall come home well. Give my love to Lillie, Kitty and Freddie
    and tell him I will come and see him by and by. You will receive 3/0 shilling
    from me and the same from the War Office which will make six all together. Give
    my love to all\u2026 This is all at present. \r\nSo goodbye from your loving son,

    Mother\r\nJust a line to let you know that I am quite well. I am for the front
    on Tuesday. But if you write to the Commanding Officer and say I am only seventeen
    it will stop me from going. Get it here before Tuesday for I cannot get a pass
    to come and see you. Don\u2019t forget.\r\nFrom Stephen\r\n\r\n\r\nMother\r\nJust
    left for France\r\nStephen\r\n\r\n\r\nDear Mother\r\nJust a line to let you know
